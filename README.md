Personal website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [Notion API](https://notion.so/) - WIP

This website is deployed using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

Check out the [live version](https://tracing-code.vercel.app)!

## About the Site
As mentioned, this site is created using Nextjs and Notion as its CMS. 

### Why Nextjs?
The site is static and fetching all the data at build time was the best way to go in terms of performance. Additionally, Nextjs comes with built-in optimization features.

### Why Notion?
Notion is free and I already use it for my day to day tasks. It made sense to also use it to write blog posts.
### Why Sass
I chose to use Sass over styled components and TailwindCSS because I love having CSS in separate files. Howeveer, I recognize the benefits of a library like styled components which allows you to have all the component code in one file.
### Why TypeScript?
I am learning TypeScript and this project gave me an opportunity to practice.

## Lessons Learned
This project is not yet done but so far the biggests lessons I have learned are about git branching, typescript events, data fetching in NextJS, and that writing accessible code is a must.
